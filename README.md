## Case

minaneko uses a single peice case with a screw in weight aswell as a battery/seccond weight slot
the weight uses 2 m3 screws 
other weight uses duct tape lol
plan to add some engravings lining the weight just need to find an artist to do this

case is also suprisingly cheap to get manufactured even with a cncd brass weight
