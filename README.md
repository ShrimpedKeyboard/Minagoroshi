# Minaneko
## All cats



the minaneko is a 40% keyboard with a southpaw numpad with an optional drop in trackpad to replace the numpad

## Case

minaneko uses a single peice case with a screw in weight aswell as a battery/seccond weight slot
the weight uses 2 m3 screws 
other weight uses duct tape lol
weight engravings draw by sune

pcb and plate mounts with a basic oring / a spring mount similar to the akko spr67 using tpu mounting points on the top of any 16mm switch spring 150g ones will be included to go on top of the 15 spring mounting points inside the case 

case is also suprisingly cheap to get manufactured even with a cncd brass weight

## PCB

A hotswap RP2040 pcb with the numpad using a seperate pcb conected by jst/ribbon cable with an rgb strip header for underglow inside of polycarbonate/pmma cases
instead of the numpad you have to option to replace it with a trackpad all though i still have to figgure this out and it is very confusing
